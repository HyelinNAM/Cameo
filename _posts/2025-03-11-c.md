    - text: "Given a text prompt, we first disentangle it to separate motion-related and semantic components. 
            The motion prompt is converted into an initial motion sequence via a text-to-motion model. 
            The sequence is rendered as SMPL-based guidance videos, where a camera-aware conditioning module determines the viewpoints for rendering.
            Finally, the video diffusion model synthesizes the human video, guided by the semantic prompt and motion condition, seamlessly bridging text-to-motion and text-to-video generation."
